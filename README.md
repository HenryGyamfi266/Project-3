# Project Description
Part 1: Python Code Analysis
In this first part of the project, I implemented a script to analyze a Python file by counting specific control flow statements. 
The user inputs a Python file name, and the script reads its contents. It counts occurrences of for, while, if, and else statements, ignoring comments. 
Finally, the results are displayed, and a check is performed to ensure that every else statement has a corresponding if. 
This part demonstrates basic file handling, string processing, and flow control analysis in Python.

## Part 2: File Encryption
The second part focuses on implementing a simple encryption method using the XOR cipher. The user provides an input file, an output file, and an encryption key. 
The script encrypts lowercase letters by applying XOR with the given key, marking encrypted characters with "~". The result is written to the output file. 
This demonstrates fundamental cryptography concepts, file I/O, and the use of ASCII operations in Python, showcasing an understanding of encryption methods.

## Part 3: File Decryption
The third part of the project handles decryption, reversing the process from Part 2. The user specifies an encrypted input file, an output file, and the decryption key. 
The script reads the encrypted file, detects encrypted characters marked with "~", and applies XOR decryption using the key. The decrypted content is then written to the output file. 
This part illustrates effective decryption techniques, error handling, and control flow, completing a simple encryption-decryption cycle.
